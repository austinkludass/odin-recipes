        <p>This is a real spaghetti carbonara recipe made the traditional Italian way, without a single drop of cream. It relies solely on egg and cheese to make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. Food fit for a king (or queen!) that proves simple can be magnificent.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g guanciale</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>100g parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Guanciale - Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li>Carbonara sauce - Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
        <li>Reserve pasta water - Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook guanciale - While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed - as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
        <li>Pasta in pan - Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
        <li>Mix pasta in sauce - Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li>Add sausages and peas, bring to simmer and cook for 3 minutes or until sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Serve - Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
