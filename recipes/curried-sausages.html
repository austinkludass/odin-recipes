    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Curried sausages are as retro as bell bottom pants. And as the fashion astute are well aware, flares are gradually making a comeback...</p>
    <p>But curried sausages never went out of fashion as far as I'm concerned! If you're dubious about this retro classic, think of it this way: Curried Sausages are really just sausages with gravy, with addition of curry flavour. So if you like those 3 things, then this sausage recipe has your name written all over it!</p>
